# Dynamic React Blog Web Application

- Developed a responsive web platform that dynamically fetches and displays blog posts from a JSON API using the Vanilla framework for styling.
- Leveraged React's component-based architecture to create modular and reusable UI components, such as cards, which showcase blog details like title, author, date, and thumbnail.
- Enhanced user experience by providing clickable author names and ensuring data reliability through placeholder values.
- Integrated error-handling and asynchronous API calls for optimized performance and stability.
